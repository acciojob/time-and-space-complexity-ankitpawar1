    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs without taking too much time to execute.

        Space Complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. In algorithm analysis, the space complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is often expressed using big O notation, such as O(n), indicating that the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input.
